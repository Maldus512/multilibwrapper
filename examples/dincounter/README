Simple example with a custom "counting" library. The test program uses a default counter incremented with any input given but numbers; when a number is read, it starts an indipendent thread that counts down to 0 from that number on a different counter (in a different library instance).

Example usage:
    $ ./test
    \n
    main counter 0
    \n
    main counter 1
    \n
    main counter 2
    \n
    main counter 3
    4
    thread -519211264: current handle: 1
    thread -519211264 counting: 0
    thread -519211264 counting: 1
    thread -519211264 counting: 2
    \n
    main counter 4
    \n
    main counter 5
    thread -519211264 counting: 3
    thread -519211264 done
